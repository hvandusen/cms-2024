Hey!

I'm Henry Van Dusen. Thanks for checking out my site. 

My hope is to give you, the user, a sense of my work at a glance. 

As a green computer science major, I created [candusen.net](https://candusen.net) in 2012 to teach myself and explore how websites work. After messing around awhile, I started making stuff I actually liked. My early experiments and explorations are still sitting there on that domain and I still add to it from time to time. I fell in love with tools like [paper.js](https://paperjs.org) which allowed me to create rule-based imagery and randomized drawing tools. I have been using these sites as personal tools for years to create prints, drawings and paintings.

I graduated in 2015 and made websites as a freelancer for two years. Then I took a multi-media production job at [Cory Arcangel](https://coryarcangel.com)'s studio in 2017. Some of the projects I worked on are listed right here on my site. Then in 2022 I left to start my current studio to work on projects of all kinds, on and off the web.

I hope you enjoy looking at my work, and if you want to collaborate, please reach out at [henry@candusen.net](mailto:henry@candusen.net)
