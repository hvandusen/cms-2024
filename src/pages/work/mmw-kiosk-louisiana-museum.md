description: I adapted musicandthemindofthe.world to function as a kiosk
  installation at the Louisiana Museum in Humlebaek, Denmark for an exhibition
  called The Irreplaceable Human. The composition is over 8 days long so the
  kiosk is able to play it on loop and run indefinitely at the museum.

    text: "**About Music and the Mind of the World:** From 1976 to 1982, Tony Conrad
      (1940-2016) created “Music and the Mind of the World,” a piano composition
      comprising over 200 hours of recorded music. During this time everything
      Conrad played on the piano was recorded (with the incidental exception of
      perhaps three or four hours). In this endeavor – which includes the sounds
      of practicing, banging on the keys, formal exercises, experiments with the
      harmonic sonority of the piano itself, and even “On Top of Old Smokey” –
      we witness what might in essence be described as the total encounter
      between an improvising performer and the central instrument of Western
      musical culture. Now, for the first time, this influential yet largely
      unknown work has been published by Arcangel Surfware and is now available
      online for free at the domain musicandthemindofthe.world."
