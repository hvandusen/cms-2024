description: Built the front end for the second version of Conner O'Malley's
  insane website Endorphin Port in which users can chat with a virtual/real
  character named Jeremy. I built the chat application (aim was to match the
  android text style), complete with Google Text-to-Speech integration, and a
  talking 3d avatar who moves his mouth along to the generated speech audio.
