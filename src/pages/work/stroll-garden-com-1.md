description: We worked with Stroll Garden, an art gallery in LA, to design and
  produce a simple and beautiful site to showcase artists and exhibition
  photography. The homepage has an interactive feature where as the user move
  the mouse, the image in the center cycles between different artworks that have
  been shown in the gallery.
