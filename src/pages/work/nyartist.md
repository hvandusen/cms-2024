  Henry built this score-generating tool while working at Arcangel Studio in
  2018. Ny Artist is tailored to the church organ, so it allows the use of right
  hand, left hand, and foot staves. The user can control many aspects of the
  resulting scores- how long to play notes, how long to rest, how often to
  repeat, and so on. Whenever a control is changed, the score is instantly
  regenerated.

    text: The scores are visually abstract- they do not rely on notes on a 12-note
      scale. Rather they are subject to the interpretation of the performer.
