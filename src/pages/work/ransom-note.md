      M﻿y old friend [Nikolai](https://nikolaibarkats.com) wanted to add a fun
      logo to his site and had an idea about ransom letters, which felt like a
      perfect programmatic design opportunity!!!


      F﻿irst, Nikolai created lots of letter "cutouts" using popular companies logos, like Netflix, Amazon, and the like. Then, I assembled a sprite sheet organizing the columns by letter:

    text: T﻿hen, for each letter in Nikolai's name, we assign a random choice of
      letter, and can then use CSS to animate up and down the column so each
      letter can randomly flip to another letter in a fun lil' animation :)
