    text: Website I designed for the software [Cookery](https://cookery.cooking)
      made with [Cory Arcangel](https://coryarcangel.com/). The software is a
      tool that uses image deepfrying techniques that allow the user to create
      different recipes to alter image and video.

    caption: I built a looping animation using timeouts in JS to show the user how
      images are altered step by step in sequences that you can save and repeat.

    text: 'I picked a font that I thought would go well with the spongebob vibe of
      the site. I used that to write out "Cookery" for the logo.... then I
      cooked it repeatedly and found some cool results! Here are a bunch of
      candidates:'
