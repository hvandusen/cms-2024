    text: Development for jewelry brand Pink Noise. Designed by Elana Schlenker and
      Mark Pernice from [Out of Office](https://ooo-la.la). The site has a lot
      of fun doodads, like 3d models you can interact with and crazy product
      browsing marquees.

    caption: The marquee you see here is a totally custom implementation because it
      needed to repeat infinitely, auto-scroll, and be scrollable by the user as
      well.
