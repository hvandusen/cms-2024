    text: Every 30 seconds or so, one of four shark designs comes onto the screen
      and swims around randomly until it leaves the screen in a random
      direction. Click the shark to get taken to the secret page! This premium
      easter egg is a wild page where Lorien's characters fill the screen in a
      random orientation and you can bump them around on the screen with your
      mouse. Click to reset the animals!

    caption: To work at a high frame rate, I prepared a spritesheet of Lorien's
      characters, and then utilized an Offscreen Canvas and
      requestAnimationFrame to draw animals at their calculated positions.
