    text: I designed and developed the new website for the LA art gallery [Château
      Shatto](https://chateaushatto.com). Together with their team I developed
      concepts, layouts and typography styles to become a part of their new web
      identity.

    text: We scraped the prior Wordpress site using custom scripts, and built out a
      highly customized CMS to suit CS's workflow before performing a migration
      of all their past shows, artists pages, press releases, and news.

    caption: I built a simplified CV tool in the backend CMS for the gallery that
      renders CVs according to their formatting, which results in a very
      user-friendly and efficient updating process for the team.

    text: I selected the Ubuntu font, developed for the Ubuntu distribution of the
      Linux open-source operating system. Using this sans serif font, which has
      a touch of quirkiness despite its great durability fit for an OS font. The
      gallery adopted this font for their communications on the website and
      beyond.

    caption: I designed a simple archive to search through exhibitions by artist,
      title, press release content, and more.
